      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Water is vital for all living things, and plants are no exception. While we often think of water in terms of hydration or soil moisture, there’s an essential but sometimes overlooked process in plants called <strong>transpiration</strong>. It is much more than just “losing water”—it plays central roles in how plants grow, how they stay cool, how they transport nutrients, and how they interact with their environment.</p>
      <p>In this article, we’ll explore what transpiration is, how it works, why it’s so important for plants, what factors affect its rate, and what adaptations plants have evolved to manage transpiration efficiently. By the end, you’ll understand not just that plants need water, but why they need to lose a lot of it in the process.</p>

      <h2>What is Transpiration?</h2>
      <p>Transpiration is the process by which plants lose water vapor from their aerial (above‑ground) parts, especially leaves, stems, and flowers. Most of the water absorbed by roots is eventually lost through the leaves. This water loss happens via tiny pores called <em>stomata</em>, which open and close to allow gas exchange—intake of carbon dioxide for photosynthesis, release of oxygen, and also water vapor. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}</p>
      <p>Although it may seem wasteful to lose so much water, transpiration is not simply side effect—it is a driving force that plants use to pull water and dissolved minerals up through their roots and xylem, maintain cell structure, and regulate internal temperature. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}</p>

      <h2>The Mechanism of Transpiration</h2>

      <h3>Water Uptake in Roots</h3>
      <p>The process begins in the soil. Plant roots absorb water (and dissolved mineral nutrients) through root hairs by osmosis. This is driven by water potential gradients — water moves from regions of higher water potential (soil) into regions of lower potential (inside the roots). :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}</p>

      <h3>Ascent through Xylem</h3>
      <p>Water that enters the roots travels upward through vessels called <em>xylem</em>. Two key ph
