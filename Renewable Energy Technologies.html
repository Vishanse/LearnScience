    <li>✅ <strong>Renewable and Abundant</strong>: The sun provides unlimited energy.</li>
    <li>✅ <strong>Scalable</strong>: Ranges from small community projects to utility-scale plants.</li>
    <li>✅ <strong>Low Maintenance</strong>: Minimal upkeep after installation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>⚠️ Challenges and Considerations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>⚠️ <strong>Land Usage</strong>: Requires large areas, which may compete with farming or wildlife.</li>
    <li>⚠️ <strong>Intermittency</strong>: No energy production at night or during poor weather.</li>
    <li>⚠️ <strong>High Upfront Costs</strong>: Though decreasing, installation costs are still significant.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🔮 Emerging Trends in Solar Farming</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Floating Solar Farms</strong>: Installed on water bodies, saving land and reducing evaporation.</li>
    <li><strong>Agrivoltaics</strong>: Growing crops under solar panels for dual land use.</li>
    <li><strong>Battery Storage</strong>: Stores excess power for use at night or during peak demand.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📊 Global Impact</h2>
  <p>Countries like <strong>India, China, and the U.S.</strong> are leading in solar farm deployment. Mega projects like the Bhadla Solar Park in India and Tengger Desert Solar Park in China can power millions of homes while reducing carbon emissions.</p>
