      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The water cycle is nature’s way of continuously moving water through the air, land, and oceans. But as the planet warms, this balanced cycle is facing major disruptions. From rising evaporation rates to changes in precipitation, climate change is reshaping how water behaves around the globe.</p>

      <h2>Key Impacts of Climate Change on the Water Cycle</h2>

      <h3>1. More Evaporation and Transpiration</h3>
      <p>Higher global temperatures cause more water to evaporate from oceans, lakes, and soil. Plants also "exhale" more water vapor through transpiration. Together, these processes add more moisture to the atmosphere, which can fuel heavier storms — or leave areas even drier when the moisture doesn’t return as rain.</p>

      <div class="fun-fact">Fun Fact: For every 1°C rise in temperature, the atmosphere can hold 7% more water vapor!</div>

      <h3>2. Changing Precipitation Patterns</h3>
      <p>With more moisture in the air, some regions experience heavier rain and snow. Others face longer dry spells. Seasonal patterns are also shifting — affecting agriculture, water storage, and weather predictability.</p>

      <h3>3. Shrinking Glaciers and Snowpack</h3>
      <p>Melting glaciers and earlier snowmelt reduce water availability in many mountain-fed river systems. Communities downstream may see more flooding in spring but face drought in summer.</p>

      <h3>4. Sea Level Rise and Saltwater Intrusion</h3>
      <p>As ice caps melt and ocean water expands, sea levels rise. This can push salty ocean water into freshwater aquifers near coastlines, contaminating drinking and irrigation water supplies.</p>

      <h3>5. Groundwater Recharge Disruptions</h3>
      <p>Heavy rains that fall quickly often run off the surface rather than soaking into the ground. This reduces the recharge of aquifers that supply drinking water to billions of people.</p>

      <h3>6. More Extreme Weather Events</h3>
      <p>Climate change intensifies the water cycle’s extremes — longer droughts, more intense storms, and unpredictable flooding. These weather shifts stress both natural ecosystems and human systems.</p>
