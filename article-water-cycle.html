      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Have you ever wondered where the rain comes from, or why puddles disappear after a sunny day? It’s all part of a fascinating, never-ending process called the <strong>water cycle</strong>, or <em>hydrological cycle</em>. This natural system continuously moves water through the Earth’s atmosphere, land, and oceans — keeping all living things alive.</p>
      <p>In this article, we’ll dive into the key stages of the water cycle, explore its importance, and look at how it’s being affected by climate change.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>🔁 Key Stages of the Water Cycle</h2>

      <h3>1. Evaporation</h3>
      <p>The sun heats up water in rivers, lakes, and oceans, turning it into water vapor. This vapor rises into the air.</p>
<p>When the sun warms oceans, rivers, lakes, and even puddles, some of the water molecules gain enough energy to break free from the surface and rise into the atmosphere as water vapor. This is an essential step in moving water from Earth’s surface into the sky.</p>
    <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Water from the sea surface turning into vapor on a hot day.</li>
      <li>A wet sidewalk drying after the sun comes out.</li>


      
      <div class="fun-fact">🌞 Fun Fact: The ocean provides about 90% of the moisture in our atmosphere!</div>

      <h3>2. Transpiration</h3>
      <p>Plants also release water into the air — through a process called <strong>transpiration</strong>. It’s like the plants are “breathing” out water vapor from their leaves.</p>
      <p><strong>Transpiration</strong> is similar to evaporation but occurs in plants. Plants absorb water through their roots, and some of that water travels up to the leaves. From there, it escapes into the air through small pores called <em>stomata</em>.</p>
    <p>This process plays a critical role in maintaining the atmosphere's moisture and also helps regulate plant temperature.</p>
    <p><strong>Combined Process:</strong><br>Evaporation and transpiration together are often called <em>evapotranspiration</em>.</p>
    <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong><br>Forests release massive amounts of moisture into the air daily. This is why cutting down forests can reduce rainfall in an area.</p>

      <div class="fun-fact">🌿 Plants play a surprisingly big role in the water cycle, especially in rainforests.</div>

      <h3>3. Condensation</h3>
      <p>As the water vapor rises and cools, it turns into tiny droplets, forming clouds. This process is called <strong>condensation</strong>.</p>
     <p>After water vapor rises high into the atmosphere, it cools down. When it cools, it transforms back into tiny liquid water droplets. This change from gas to liquid is called <strong>condensation</strong>.</p>
    <p>These droplets gather around tiny particles in the air (like dust or salt) to form clouds or fog.</p>
    <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clouds forming in the sky.</li>
      <li>Water droplets on the outside of a cold soda can.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong><br>Condensation is the step that turns invisible water vapor into visible clouds, which leads to precipitation. Without it, we wouldn’t get rain or snow.</p>

      
      
      
      
      <div class="fun-fact">💡 Ever noticed water forming on the outside of a cold glass? That’s condensation too!</div>

      <h3>4. Precipitation</h3>
      <p>When the clouds get heavy, they release water as <strong>rain, snow, hail, or sleet</strong> — depending on temperature and conditions.</p>
      
      <p>When the water droplets in clouds become too heavy to stay suspended, they fall back to Earth as <strong>precipitation</strong>. This can be in various forms:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Rain</strong> (liquid water)</li>
      <li><strong>Snow</strong> (ice crystals)</li>
      <li><strong>Sleet</strong> (ice pellets)</li>
      <li><strong>Hail</strong> (frozen balls of layered ice)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>What Determines the Type of Precipitation?</strong><br>It depends on the temperature in the air. Warm air leads to rain, while cold air produces snow or ice.</p>
    <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong><br>Precipitation is how water returns to Earth’s surface. It replenishes lakes, rivers, soil moisture, and groundwater supplies.</p>

      
      
      
      
      <div class="fun-fact">☔ In tropical areas, this stage fuels heavy monsoon rains — vital for farming.</div>

      <h3>5. Collection (Runoff & Infiltration)</h3>
      <p>Precipitated water either:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Runs off into rivers, lakes, and oceans, or</li>
        <li>Soaks into the ground (called <strong>infiltration</strong>), replenishing underground aquifers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This completes the cycle and prepares water for evaporation again.</p>

<h2>🏞️ 6. Runoff – Surface Flow of Water</h2>
    <p>Not all rainwater soaks into the ground. Some flows over land surfaces, especially when the ground is saturated, frozen, or covered by pavement or rocks. This is called <strong>runoff</strong>.</p>
    <p>Runoff moves water from high areas to lower areas, eventually reaching rivers, lakes, and oceans.</p>
    <p><strong>Why It’s Important:</strong><br>Runoff helps redistribute water across landscapes. However, excessive runoff, especially in urban areas, can cause <strong>flooding</strong> or carry <strong>pollutants</strong> into natural waterways.</p>

    <h2>🌱 7. Infiltration – Water Soaks Into the Ground</h2>
    <p><strong>Infiltration</strong> is the process where water seeps into the soil and becomes part of the <strong>groundwater system</strong>. This happens mostly in areas where the soil is porous and not saturated.</p>
    <p><strong>What Happens After Infiltration?</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Water may be taken up by plant roots.</li>
      <li>It may collect in underground layers (called <em>aquifers</em>).</li>
      <li>Eventually, groundwater can return to the surface through <em>springs</em> or <em>wells</em>.</li>


<h2>🌦️ How These Stages Work Together</h2>
    <p>All of these processes are part of a <strong>closed loop</strong>. Here’s how they connect:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Evaporation & Transpiration</strong> send moisture into the air.</li>
      <li><strong>Condensation</strong> forms clouds.</li>
      <li><strong>Precipitation</strong> returns water to the ground.</li>
      <li><strong>Collection</strong>, <strong>runoff</strong>, and <strong>infiltration</strong> distribute and store water.</li>
      <li>The sun starts the process again.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The cycle never stops. It may take minutes for water to evaporate and return as rain, or it could take hundreds of years for groundwater to resurface.</p>

    <h2>🔍 Real-World Applications of the Water Cycle</h2>
    <h3>🌾 In Agriculture:</h3>
    <p>Farmers rely on rainfall and groundwater for irrigation. Understanding the water cycle helps them plan better for planting and droughts.</p>
    <h3>🏙️ In Urban Planning:</h3>
    <p>Cities manage runoff using storm drains and green spaces to avoid flooding.</p>
    <h3>🌍 In Climate Science:</h3>
    <p>Climate change is shifting patterns in the water cycle — including stronger storms, longer droughts, and melting glaciers.</p>

    <h2>🧠 Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>The <strong>water cycle</strong> is one of Earth’s most important natural systems. It recycles water, nourishes plants, maintains rivers and lakes, and regulates climate. Each stage — from <strong>evaporation</strong> to <strong>infiltration</strong> — plays a unique role in keeping life thriving on our planet.</p>
    <p>By understanding how the water cycle works, we can better manage our water use, protect the environment, and prepare for a changing climate.</p>
