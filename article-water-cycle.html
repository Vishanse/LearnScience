    <p>The water cycle, also known as the hydrologic cycle, is a continuous movement of water within the Earth and atmosphere. It is nature's way of recycling water and ensuring that life can thrive. The water you drink today could have once been rain falling on the Amazon rainforest or part of an iceberg floating in the Arctic. This remarkable system not only sustains ecosystems but also regulates weather, supports agriculture, and provides fresh water to people and animals around the world.</p>

    <h3>1. Evaporation and Transpiration</h3>
    <p>The water cycle begins with the process of evaporation. When the Sun heats up water in oceans, lakes, rivers, or even puddles, it turns from liquid to vapor. This invisible water vapor rises into the atmosphere. Plants also contribute through a process called transpiration, where they release water vapor from their leaves into the air. Together, evaporation and transpiration are known as evapotranspiration.</p>

    <h3>2. Condensation: The Formation of Clouds</h3>
    <p>As the water vapor rises higher into the cooler regions of the atmosphere, it begins to cool down. When it cools enough, the water vapor condenses into tiny water droplets or ice crystals. These droplets come together to form clouds. This process is called condensation. Without it, clouds would not exist, and rain would never fall.</p>

    <h3>3. Precipitation: Rain, Snow, Sleet, or Hail</h3>
    <p>When clouds accumulate enough water droplets and become too heavy, gravity pulls the water back down to Earth in the form of precipitation. Precipitation can occur as rain, snow, sleet, or hail, depending on the temperature in the atmosphere and at ground level. This step returns water to the surface of the planet.</p>

    <h3>4. Collection and Infiltration</h3>
    <p>After precipitation falls to the ground, the water gathers in various places such as rivers, lakes, oceans, or underground reservoirs. Some of the water flows over the surface as runoff, eventually reaching large bodies of water. Some of it seeps into the soil, where it becomes groundwater. This water may be stored in underground aquifers for years before resurfacing through springs or wells.</p>

    <h3>Why Is the Water Cycle Important?</h3>
    <p>The water cycle is essential for maintaining a stable environment. It helps regulate the Earth's temperature, supports plant growth, and distributes freshwater across the globe. Every living organism depends on water, and without the water cycle, freshwater would not be renewed or available for use.</p>

    <h3>Quick Facts:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>About 97% of the Earth's water is in the oceans and is salty.</li>
      <li>Only around 3% of the Earth's water is freshwater, and much of it is frozen in glaciers.</li>
      <li>The Sun is the primary energy source driving the entire water cycle.</li>
      <li>Water can stay in some parts of the cycle for years—like groundwater trapped deep underground.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The water cycle is a fascinating, essential process that impacts every part of life on Earth. By understanding how it works, we can better protect water resources and appreciate the delicate balance of nature that sustains us all.</p>
