    <h2>Structure of an Atom</h2>





    

    <p>Everything around us — from the air we breathe to the food we eat — is made up of atoms. Atoms are the smallest units of matter that retain the properties of an element. Although atoms are incredibly tiny, they have a complex internal structure made of even smaller particles.</p>

    <h3>What Is an Atom?</h3>
    <p>An atom is the basic building block of matter. Each atom consists of a central nucleus and a surrounding cloud of electrons. The type of atom (or element) is determined by the number of protons in its nucleus.</p>

    <h3>Parts of an Atom</h3>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Protons:</strong> Positively charged particles found in the nucleus. The number of protons defines the element (e.g., hydrogen has 1 proton).</li>
      <li><strong>Neutrons:</strong> Neutral particles with no charge, also located in the nucleus. Neutrons help stabilize the atom.</li>
      <li><strong>Electrons:</strong> Negatively charged particles that orbit the nucleus in energy levels or shells. They are much smaller than protons or neutrons.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Nucleus</h3>
    <p>The nucleus is the dense center of the atom. It contains protons and neutrons and holds nearly all of the atom’s mass. Despite its small size, the nucleus has a strong positive charge due to the protons.</p>

    <h3>Electron Shells and Orbitals</h3>
    <p>Electrons move around the nucleus in areas called shells or energy levels. Each shell can hold a certain number of electrons. The arrangement of electrons affects how atoms interact with each other and form chemical bonds.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>1st shell: Up to 2 electrons</li>
      <li>2nd shell: Up to 8 electrons</li>
      <li>3rd shell: Up to 18 electrons</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Atomic Number and Mass Number</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Atomic Number:</strong> The number of protons in an atom. This number is unique for each element.</li>
      <li><strong>Mass Number:</strong> The total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Isotopes</h3>
    <p>Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons are called <strong>isotopes</strong>. For example, carbon-12 and carbon-14 are both forms of carbon, but they have different mass numbers.</p>

    <h3>Why Atom Structure Matters</h3>
    <p>The structure of atoms determines how elements behave and react in nature. Understanding atoms helps explain everything from chemical reactions to electricity to nuclear energy.</p>

    <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Atoms are mostly empty space — if the nucleus were a golf ball, the electrons would be orbiting over a football field away.</li>
      <li>There are over 100 known elements, each made of unique atoms.</li>
      <li>The word “atom” comes from the Greek word "atomos," meaning "indivisible."</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Atoms are the tiny yet powerful building blocks of the universe. By understanding the structure of atoms — protons, neutrons, and electrons — we can unlock the secrets of chemistry, physics, and how matter behaves.</p>
