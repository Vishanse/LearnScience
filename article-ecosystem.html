    <h2>Understanding Ecosystems</h2>

    <p>An <strong>ecosystem</strong> is a community of living organisms — such as plants, animals, and microbes — interacting with each other and their physical environment, including air, water, and soil. Ecosystems can be as large as a rainforest or as small as a puddle. They are vital for maintaining the balance of nature and supporting life on Earth.</p>

    <h3>Components of an Ecosystem</h3>
    <p>Ecosystems are made up of two main components:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Biotic Factors:</strong> These include all living things, such as animals, plants, bacteria, fungi, and insects.</li>
      <li><strong>Abiotic Factors:</strong> These are non-living things like sunlight, temperature, water, soil, and air.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Types of Ecosystems</h3>
    <p>Ecosystems exist all around the world in various forms. Some examples include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Forest Ecosystems:</strong> Found in tropical, temperate, and boreal regions; rich in biodiversity.</li>
      <li><strong>Desert Ecosystems:</strong> Dry, hot areas with plants like cacti and animals adapted to extreme conditions.</li>
      <li><strong>Freshwater Ecosystems:</strong> Rivers, lakes, ponds, and streams where aquatic life thrives.</li>
      <li><strong>Marine Ecosystems:</strong> Oceans and seas that support coral reefs, fish, and marine mammals.</li>
      <li><strong>Grassland Ecosystems:</strong> Open areas with few trees, supporting herbivores like deer and zebras.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How Ecosystems Work</h3>
    <p>Every organism in an ecosystem has a role to play:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Producers:</strong> Plants that make their own food through photosynthesis.</li>
      <li><strong>Consumers:</strong> Animals that eat plants (herbivores), other animals (carnivores), or both (omnivores).</li>
      <li><strong>Decomposers:</strong> Fungi and bacteria that break down dead organisms and return nutrients to the soil.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Energy flows through ecosystems in a chain or web. It begins with the sun, moves through producers and consumers, and ends with decomposers. This cycle keeps the ecosystem balanced.</p>

    <h3>Why Ecosystems Are Important</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>They provide clean air, water, and fertile soil.</li>
      <li>They regulate climate and help prevent flooding and erosion.</li>
      <li>They are home to countless species that support biodiversity.</li>
      <li>They supply resources like food, medicine, and materials.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Threats to Ecosystems</h3>
    <p>Many ecosystems are under threat due to human activities such as deforestation, pollution, climate change, and overfishing. These disruptions can lead to habitat loss and the extinction of species.</p>

    <h3>Protecting Ecosystems</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Recycle and reduce waste.</li>
      <li>Use natural resources wisely.</li>
      <li>Support conservation efforts and sustainable practices.</li>
      <li>Plant trees and protect natural habitats.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Ecosystems are complex yet beautifully balanced systems that sustain life. By learning about and protecting them, we help preserve the Earth for future generations.</p>
